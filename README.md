## Run on your machine

Please make sure you have following software installed in your system:

- Node.js
- NPM / Yarn

First you need to clone the repository:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/robin3317/Personal_Website_Astro.git
```

Then you have to install the necessary dependencies using either NPM or Yarn:

```
$ npm i
```

Or

```
$ yarn
```

I'm using YouTube Data Api V3, for that you need to store api key and channel id to the environment variable(in the `.env` file). Your `.env` file should look like that

```
YT_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
YT_CHANNEL_ID={YOUR_CHANNEL_ID}
```

Now you are ready to run the application. In the project directory, you can run:

```
$ npm start
```

This will run the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

> I appreciate to create your own version of using this.
